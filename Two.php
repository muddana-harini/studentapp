We treat patients with unconditional love and affection which tends to their speed recovery process.

Notable ventures introduced by the organization are Save a Child's Heart Initiative (SACHi) which provides quality paediatric cardiac care to children from underprivileged sections of society. SAHI (Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired) and the CURE Foundation focused on cancer care assist children from financially challenged homes. Envisioned by Dr. Reddy, to introduce population health into the Indian narrative, the Total Health Foundation is piloting a unique model of healthcare in the Thavanampalle Mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to provide "healthcare" for the entire community starting from birth, through one's journey into childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.<br><br>
In a rare honour, the Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in recognition of HEALTHCARE's widespread contributions, the first for a healthcare organization. Dr. Harish Chilakala, Founder Chairman of the HEALTHCARE Hospitals Group has been conferred with the prestigious Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.
